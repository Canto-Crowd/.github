[Canto](https://canto.io/) Blockchain is a permissionless general-purpose blockchain running the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It was built to deliver on the promise of DeFi â€“ that through a post-traditional financial movement, new systems will be made accessible, transparent, decentralized, and free.
Giving an accessible way through a crowdfunding platform to get support for developing new ideas on the [Canto](https://canto.io/) Blockchain will help ecosystem growth.

Each new project created on the Canto Crowd application will be getting funding from individuals but additional throw a quadratic funding model these projects have the opportunity to get more funds for their projects.

To keep a continue improvment and  offering the best experience in our platform DAO will keep 5%  from funds to cover expenses and continue  development a better solution.
